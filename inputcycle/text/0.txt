This is a graph with 3 processes and 3resources. This is a graphical simulation of resource allocation. Our system holds for mutual exclusion: no two processes can own the same resource at the same time, hold and wait: a process must be holding at least one resouce and be waiting to aquire resources that are owned by another process, no preemption: process can not steal resources from  another process before a process is finished with a resource, and circular: there is a cycle of a processes dependent on other processes.
