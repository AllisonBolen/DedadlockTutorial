This is a graph with 1 processes and 2resources.Using this graph you will see the methodology of resource allocation.Make sure to keep and eye out for deadlock conditions. Our system holds for mutual exclusion: no two processes can own the smae resource at the same time, hold and wait: a process must be holding at least one resouce and be waiting to aquire resources that are owned by another process, no preemption: process can not steal resources from another process before the process is finished with the resource, and circular: where there is a cycle of a process wating on a reousrce where the owner of that resource is waiting for the process who is wating for it.
